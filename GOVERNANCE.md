# OpenData Governance

This document describes the governance model for the OpenData project.

## Current Status

OpenData is in its early stages. The governance structure described here is
temporary and will be formalized as the project and community mature.

## Committers

Committers have write access to the repository and are responsible for reviewing
and merging contributions.

While bootstrapping the project, the following individuals have been granted
commit access. If you are interested in becoming a founding commiter, please
open a GitHub issue and one of us will schedule some time to review your
background and evaluate your fit for the project.

- [@agavra](https://github.com/agavra)
- [@apurvam](https://github.com/apurvam)
- [@cadonna](https://github.com/cadonna)
- [@hachikuji](https://github.com/hachikuji)
- [@rodesai](https://github.com/rodesai)

## Decision Making

- **Day-to-day decisions** (code review, minor features, bug fixes) are made by individual committers
- **Significant changes** require an approved [RFC](CONTRIBUTING.md#rfcs) with sign-off from two committers
- **Governance changes** require supermajority approval among all committers

## Path to Committer

Contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions may be
nominated for committer status. Factors considered include:

- Quality and impact of contributions
- Understanding of the project architecture and goals
- Constructive participation in code reviews and discussions
- Commitment to the project's long-term success

Committer nominations are adopted by three +1 votes from existing committers
and no -1 votes.
